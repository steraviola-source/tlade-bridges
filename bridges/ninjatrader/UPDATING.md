# Updating the NT8 Bridge

When a new version of `TLAdeBridge.cs` ships, NinjaTrader does **not** pick it
up automatically. Three steps are needed — skipping any of them leaves the
old version running.

## 1. Replace the file

Download the latest [`TLADe-NT8-Bridge.zip`][zip], extract it, and copy the
new `TLAdeBridge.cs` over your existing one:

```
Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom\Indicators\TLAdeBridge.cs
```

Overwrite the old file.

## 2. Force NinjaScript Editor to reload from disk

If you had NinjaScript Editor open before the update, the previous version
of the file is still cached in its in-memory buffer — `F5` would just
recompile the stale copy.

- Close the `TLAdeBridge.cs` tab inside the editor (Ctrl+W or click the X
  on the tab).
- Re-open it: in the left tree under **Indicators** → double-click
  `TLAdeBridge`. The buffer is now fresh from disk.
- Press **F5**. You should see `Compile successful — 0 errors` at the
  bottom of the editor.

If the compile fails, paste the error output to support — don't proceed
with a stale binary loaded on the chart.

## 3. Remove + re-add the indicator on the chart

NinjaTrader keeps the previously-compiled indicator instance running on
your chart until you explicitly detach it. F5 alone does not swap it.

- On your 5-min ES or NQ chart: right-click the `TLAdeBridge` indicator
  in the legend → **Remove**.
- Right-click the chart → **Indicators…** → select `TLAdeBridge` → **Add**
  → **OK**.

On re-attach, the backfill of the most recent ~500 closed bars replays
toward the receiver, and the live-bar push starts immediately.

## 4. (Optional) Hard refresh the terminal browser

To clear any cached candle source state in the browser:
**Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows / Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (macOS).

After that the LWChart should paint sub-second, not only at 5-minute
closes.

## Troubleshooting

If chart candles still don't update live after the three steps above,
open NinjaScript's **Output Window** (View → New → NinjaScript Output)
and look for lines starting with `[TLAdeBridge]`. Send a screenshot to
support — that log tells us exactly what the indicator is doing.

Common causes:
- The Python receiver (`tlade_bridge_nt8.py`) was not restarted and an
  older instance is still bound to port 5000. Stop it (Ctrl+C in its
  terminal) and re-run `python tlade_bridge_nt8.py`.
- The chart was on a non-front-month contract (e.g. an expired ES roll).
  Switch to the active front contract.
- The terminal browser has a stale `tlade_source_choice` in
  `localStorage` set to `'yahoo-always'` — open DevTools (F12) →
  Application → Local Storage → remove that key, then reload.
